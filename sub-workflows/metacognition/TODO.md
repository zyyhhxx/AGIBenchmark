## Done
- [x] Read competition page, rules, and submission format
- [x] Read DeepMind paper "Measuring Progress Toward AGI: A Cognitive Taxonomy"
- [x] Understand kaggle-benchmarks SDK (cookbook, examples)
- [x] Download paper to drive/papers/
- [x] Strategic track selection → Metacognition (#1) + Learning (#2)
- [x] Design Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK) benchmark for LLMs → task_fok.py
- [x] Design Judgment-of-Learning (JOL) calibration benchmark → task_jol.py + jol_stimuli.py
- [x] Design error detection benchmark → task_error_detection.py + error_detection_chains.py
- [x] Design Learning track: learning curves → task_learning_curves.py + rule_systems.py
- [x] Design Learning track: near vs. far transfer → task_transfer.py
- [x] Design Learning track: proactive/retroactive interference → task_interference.py
- [x] Implement first benchmark using kaggle-benchmarks SDK patterns → all tasks use @kbench.task
- [x] Write cognitive science rationale for each benchmark → COGNITIVE_RATIONALE.md
- [x] Review existing Kaggle submissions for inspiration/gaps → research/competition_landscape.md
